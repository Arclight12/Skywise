\section{Conclusions}

This project successfully developed and evaluated an intelligent satellite downlink prioritization system using a two-stage classification and scheduling approach. The system addresses the critical problem of limited bandwidth by: (1) filtering unnecessary data (cloudy, low-quality, stale images) before scheduling, and (2) optimizing transmission order to maximize total priority value.

\subsection{Key Findings}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A* Search achieves 2.59x better performance than Greedy with 88\% bandwidth utilization
    \item Simulated Annealing provides competitive performance (2.35x better than Greedy)
    \item Classification successfully filters low-value data (95\% acceptance rate)
    \item The two-stage approach effectively combines filtering and optimization
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A two-stage framework combining classification and scheduling
    \item Multi-factor heuristic scoring function for image prioritization
    \item Implementation and comparison of three scheduling algorithms
    \item Experimental validation on realistic satellite imagery metadata
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement realistic visibility windows using orbital mechanics
    \item Test on larger datasets (100-1000 images)
    \item Optimize A* with beam search or state pruning for scalability
    \item Integrate machine learning for dynamic priority weight adaptation
    \item Extend to multi-satellite coordination
    \item Deploy for real-time onboard satellite processing
\end{enumerate}

The intelligent satellite downlink prioritization system demonstrates significant improvements over naive scheduling approaches. A* Search emerges as the best-performing algorithm, achieving 2.5x better results than Greedy scheduling. This work provides a solid foundation for practical deployment in satellite operations.
